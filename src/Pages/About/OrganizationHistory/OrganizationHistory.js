        The Notredamians' Society of Jagannath University, established in 2019,
        is a unique organization that brings together former students of Notre
        Dame College who are currently or were previously enrolled at Jagannath
        University. The society was founded with the aim of fostering a strong
        sense of community among its members, providing a platform for mutual
        support, and engaging in various social and cultural activities. Since
        its inception, the organization has grown steadily, boasting a current
        membership of 1,024 individuals, with an annual increase of
        approximately 50 members. <br /> <br />
        From the very beginning, the Notredamians' Society has been governed
        through a fully democratic process, ensuring that its executive
        committee is elected by the members. This democratic tradition has been
        a cornerstone of the organization, fostering a sense of ownership and
        responsibility among its members. The society is not just a social club;
        it is a community dedicated to making a positive impact on society,
        particularly for those who are less fortunate. <br />
        <br />
        One of the most significant activities of the Notredamians Society of
        Jagannath University is its charitable work. The organization has
        consistently engaged in various philanthropic initiatives, particularly
        focusing on supporting the poor and needy. For instance, the society has
        organized the distribution of Eid gifts to underprivileged families,
        ensuring that they too can celebrate the festive occasion with joy.
        Additionally, the society has regularly arranged Iftar distribution
        during the holy month of Ramadan, providing meals to those who might not
        otherwise afford them. In times of natural disasters or other crises,
        the society has been at the forefront of relief efforts, offering aid
        and support to those affected. <br />
        <br />
        In addition to its charitable activities, the Notre Damians Society also
        places a strong emphasis on fostering camaraderie and a sense of
        belonging among its members. The organization regularly hosts a variety
        of festive events and programs, which serve to strengthen the bonds
        among members and create lasting memories. Among the most notable of
        these events are the Freshers' Reception, which welcomes new members
        into the society, and the Iftar Mahfil, a gathering during Ramadan that
        brings members together for a shared meal. The society also organizes an
        annual reunion, which is a major event on the calendar, providing an
        opportunity for all members to come together, reminisce about their
        shared experiences, and celebrate their connection to both Notre Dame
        College and Jagannath University. <br />
        <br />
        In conclusion, the Notre Damians Society of Jagannath University is a
        vibrant and dynamic organization that plays a significant role in the
        lives of its members and the broader community. Through its democratic
        governance, charitable initiatives, and festive events, the society not
        only strengthens the bonds between its members but also makes a
        meaningful contribution to society at large. As the organization
        continues to grow, it will undoubtedly continue to be a source of pride
        and support for its members and a beacon of hope for those in need.
